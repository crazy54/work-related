# JHall's Blackline Engineering Monster Shell
<p style="text-align: center;"> ** Use this Profile to Up Your Game! ** </p>

**Abstract:** This is just my Powershell profile that I have been using on and off for the last few years. It contains lots of helpful Functions to help make your life easier.  Most all of the functions have their help in the .ps1 so you may have to open it to get the syntax.

## Installation

To install this for your user, make a directory called **WindowsPowerShell** in your *Documents* folder.  This is now your root profile directory. Please make sure you place the lib folder inside as well or you will have errors when you launch PowerShell.

## Features

The meat and potatoes are contained in the list below - enjoy!

1. Cowsay is ported over and works like a charm.  Also to note, CowThink is also installed, so there is that too...  
2. Posh-Git: This has a check and autoinstaller wrapped up in the profile for you.  Don't have Posh-git?  You do  now!

3.  Tons of functions just for Engineers. Take a look and make sure to be familiar with them all before using them.  

  ** I will be typing up a ReadMe for all functions in the coming month and then posting it here **

<p style="text-align: center;"> ### Please let me know if you have any questions or issues so I can get them checked in ASAP.
